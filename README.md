[Ambi Climate](https://www.ambiclimate.com/) plugin for [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).  This plugin presently supports:
* Current Temperature (implementation of Temperature Sensor Service)
* Current Relative Humidity (Implementation of Humidity Sensor Service)
* Turn On/Off (Implementation of Switch) - where "off" and "on" modes are configurable

as such each physical device appears within HomeKit Apps as three logical devices with the same name.

## Installation

    npm install -g homebridge-ambiclimate

This plugin augments a pre-existing implementation of [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).  Refer to [nfarina/homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for installation instructions.

Register a OAuth Client in the <a href="https://api.ambiclimate.com/" target="_new">Ambi Dev Portal</a> for each Ambi Climate device by following the steps on the Quick Start page.  You require the Client Id and Client Secret of that client in order to use this wrapper.

Update your homebridge configuration file (as below).

## Configuration

    "accessories" : [
        {
            "accessory": "AmbiClimate",
            "name": "<Name for Accessory>",
            "roomName": "<Name of Ambi Climate Device>",
            "locationName": "<Name of Ambi Climate Location>",
            "clientId": "<Ambi Climate OAuth Client Id>",
            "clientSecret": "<Ambi Climate OAuth Client Secret>",
            "username": "<Ambi Climate Username>",
            "password": "<Ambi Climate Password>",
            "onMode": "Comfort",
            "offMode": "Away_Temperature_Upper",
            "offValue": 25
        }
    ]

Separate homebridge accessories can be defined for each Ambi Climate device to be controlled.  
* `accessory`: Must be "AmbiClimate"
* `name`: Can be anything, this will be the name of the Accessory within HomeKit Apps
* `room_name`: Must match the value within the Ambi Climate App
* `location_name`: Must match the value within the Ambi Climate App
* `clientId`: The Client Id value for the OAUTH Client obtained from Ambi Dev Portal
* `clientSecret`: The Client Secret value for the OAUTH Client obtained from Ambi Dev Portal
* `username`: Your Ambi Climate username
* `password`: Your Ambi Climate password
* `onMode`: (Optional) The mode to put Ambi Climate into when turning it on - defaults to Comfort
* `onValue`: (Optional) Value associated with the on mode
* `offMode`: (Optional) The mode to put Ambi Climate into when turning it offMode - defaults to Off
* `offValue`: (Optional) Value associated with the off mode

The following values are supported for `onMode` and `offMode`:
* `Comfort`
* `Off`
* `Away_Temperature_Upper`
* `Away_Temperature_Lower`
* `Away_Humidity_Upper`
* `Temperature`

## To Do
* Refactor to a Platform plugin.  This is predicated on Ambi Labs exposing a capability in their public API to retrieve all devices installed in a given location.
* Implement Thermostat Service (rather than Temperature Sensor).  This is predicated on Ambi Labs exposing a capability in their public API to get current state for each device.
* Implement Fan Service. This is predicaed on Ambi Labs exposing a capability in their public API to get and set fan state.
